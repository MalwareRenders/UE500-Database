000Terminated000.exe (very long trojan)

This malware was made by soheil shahrab, why I didn't know all of my malwares were able to run on
Windows XP, now I know it, unlike Kapi2.0Peys.exe, it dosen't contain quizes until I add a C# to C++ code.
Also, here is the source code for you :), I forgot for the previous malware. Also there is some HSL RGBQUAD
that I made using VortexGTX's RGBQUAD, and some 3D graphics like effects with RGBQUADs.

Reason that I can't make destructive version:

2. I don't want to damage anyone's computer. (Just run the safe ver)
