# ⚠️ Malware Database ⚠️
In this collection you'll find every malware I could find in many github repos, Enderman, NFTS123, FelloBoiYuuka etc.

# ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
Most samples in this repository are Malware. These can harm your device. Me and authors like N17Pro, NotCCR and others are not able any actions you do!

# 💻 How do I see them in action? 💻
That is a good question viewer, You should use tools like AppOnFly, VirtualBox or VMware to stay safe!

# 📓 Note 📓
These also contain sources which still contain the destructive content in them. Like \\.\PhysicalDrive0 Which is important for Windows to boot!
